# Generate Test codes from Tasks 
1. Generate Playwright test code in `test/task-n.spec.js` for each task.
2. Provide 3–5 test cases for each task.
3. Avoid overly strict test cases. Minimize direct assertions on CSS or HTML attributes. Instead, focus on validating the behavior of page elements—such as their size (e.g., width/height) and interactions (e.g., click, drag and drop).
