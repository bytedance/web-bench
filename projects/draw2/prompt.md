# Generate tasks from source codes

1. Analyze the source code files located in 'draw2/src-init/*' and 'draw2/src/*'.
2. Generate 20 implementation tasks that describe how to implement the features in 'draw2/src/*', based on comparisons with 'draw2/src-init/*'. Ensure no features are omitted.
3. Minimize code snippets; prioritize clear, descriptive explanations of each feature.
4. Use the shortest possible CSS selectors to identify elements.
5. Focus on detailed descriptions of each feature or behavior, while keeping HTML tag references concise.
6. Save the output as a JSON Lines file at 'draw2/tasks.jsonl'. Each line should contain one task in the following format:

```json
{"id":"task-1","date":"2025-5-29","level":"easy","description":"{task content generated by LLM}"}
{"id":"task-2","date":"2025-5-29","level":"easy","description":""}
...
```

# Generate test codes from tasks

1. Generate Playwright test codes for each task and save them to the file 'draw2/test/task-n.spec.js'.
1. Provide 3–5 test cases for each task.
1. Each test case use `page.goto('/index.html')` to open the test page
1. Ensure that the CSS selector used in the test code is consistently referenced in 'tasks.jsonl'.
1. Avoid overly strict test cases. Minimize direct assertions on CSS or HTML attributes. Instead, focus on validating the behavior of page elements—such as their size (e.g., width/height) and interactions (e.g., click, drag and drop).
