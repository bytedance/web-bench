# Zustand

## [Evaluate](../readme.md)

## Introduction

**Zustand** is a small, fast and scalable state management solution for JavaScript applications.

Its significance stems from its **minimal API**, **hooks-based approach**, and ability to provide **global state without the boilerplate**.

Zustand offers a **simple yet powerful store** that is unopinionated and can be used with any UI framework, with a focus on **simplicity and ease of use**.

With its **subscriber pattern** and hooks-first approach, it makes state management straightforward while still offering advanced capabilities like **middleware** and **transient updates**.

As a result, Zustand has become a **popular alternative to complex state managers** for applications of all sizes, widely used with React and other frameworks.
