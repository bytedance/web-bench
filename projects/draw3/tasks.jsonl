Shape container (3 label widths) is at the toolkit's left side. Operation container (6 label widths) is at the toolkit's right side. Prop container occupies the toolkit's remaining space. Add a line width input (class 'line-width', value from 1 to 21, default is 9) in the prop container. Add a color selector input (class 'color', default is #000000) in the prop container."}
