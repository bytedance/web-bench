Toolkit and canvas together fill the whole space of the browser viewport. Add a shape container (class 'shape'), a prop container (class 'prop') and an operation container (class 'operation') horizontally in the toolkit. The shape container (3 label widths) is on the toolkit's left side. The operation container (6 label widths) is on the toolkit's right side. The prop container occupies the toolkit's remaining space. Add a line width input (class 'line-width', value from 1 to 21, default is 9) in the prop container. Add a color selector input (class 'color', default is #000000) in the prop container."}

Add radio buttons wrapped by labels in the operation container with values: move, rotate, zoom, copy, delete, fill. Each radio in both shape and operation containers has the same name 'operation'. Each label's class is the value of its inner radio. Generate an SVG image using the label's class and use it as the label's background image.
