# Jotai

## [Evaluate](../readme.md)

## Introduction

**Jotai** is a primitive and flexible state management library for React applications.

Its significance stems from its **atom-based approach**, **minimal API**, and ability to provide **granular reactivity without the boilerplate**.

Jotai offers a **simple primitive called atoms** that is React-focused and built upon the Context API, with an emphasis on **composability and TypeScript support**.

With its **atomic state model** inspired by Recoil, it makes state management straightforward while still offering advanced capabilities like **atom families** and **derivations**.

As a result, Jotai has become a **popular alternative to complex state managers** for React applications of all sizes, especially where atomic, composable state is beneficial.
