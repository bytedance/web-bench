# Generate tasks from source codes

1. Please analyze source code files: 'demo2/src-init/index.html' and 'demo2/src/index.html', generate tasks which.
1. Generate 3 tasks that describe how to implement 'demo2/src/index.html' based on 'demo2/src-init/index.html'.
1. Save tasks to the file 'demo2/tasks.jsonl', format is like:

```json
{"id":"task-1","date":"2025-5-29","level":"easy","description":"{task content generated by LLM}"}
{"id":"task-2","date":"2025-5-29","level":"easy","description":""}
{"id":"task-3","date":"2025-5-29","level":"easy","description":""}
```

# Generate test codes from tasks

1. Generate Playwright test codes for each task and save them to the file `demo2/test/task-n.spec.js`.
1. each test case use `page.goto('http://localhost:3211')` to open the test page
1. Provide 3–5 test cases for each task.
1. Avoid overly strict test cases. Minimize direct assertions on CSS or HTML attributes. Instead, focus on validating the behavior of page elements—such as their size (e.g., width/height) and interactions (e.g., click, drag and drop).
