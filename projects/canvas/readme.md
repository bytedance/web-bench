## [Evaluate](../readme.md)

## Introduction

Canvas is an HTML5 element that provides a drawing surface for rendering graphics, animations, and other visual elements using JavaScript. It's essentially a bitmap drawing surface that allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images.

These tasks are to build a Jump Bird game step by step using Canvas API, covering core graphics rendering and game physics concepts.
