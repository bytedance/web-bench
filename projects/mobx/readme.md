# MobX

## [Evaluate](../readme.md)

## Introduction

**MobX** is a battle-tested state management library that makes it simple to connect the reactive data of your application with the UI.

Its significance stems from its **reactive programming model**, **observable-based approach**, and ability to provide **automatic tracking of state dependencies**.

MobX offers a **powerful yet straightforward system** that uses the observer pattern to automatically detect and update only what needs to be updated when state changes.

With its **observable state** and **computed values**, it makes state management intuitive while still offering advanced capabilities like **reactions**, **actions**, and **strict mode**.

As a result, MobX has become a **popular solution for complex state management** in applications of all sizes, widely used with React and other frameworks.
