# Generate tasks from source codes

1. Analyze the source code files located in 'calculator1/src-init/*' and 'calculator1/src/*'.
1. Generate 20 implementation tasks that describe how to implement the features in 'calculator1/src/*', based on comparisons with 'calculator1/src-init/*'. 
1. Ensure no features are omitted.
1. Focus on feature-level requirements. Reduce styling-related tasks unless they are essential (e.g., dark mode).
1. Generate tasks from level easy to level challenging.
1. Prioritize clear, descriptive explanations of each UI feature. Minimize discussion of JavaScript, CSS, or HTML implementation details — only include the shortest possible CSS selectors necessary to identify relevant elements.
1. Save the output as a file at 'calculator1/tasks.yml' with the following format:

```yaml
- id: task-1
  date: 2025-06-03
  level: easy
  description: |
    1. task content generated by LLM
    2. make sure identify an element (`.className` or `#id`)

- id: task-2
  date: 2025-05-12
  level: "one of easy, medium, challenging"
  description: |
    ...
```

# Generate test codes from tasks

1. Generate Playwright test codes for each task and save them to the file 'calculator1/test/task-n.spec.js'.
1. Provide 3 test cases for each task.
1. Each test case use `page.goto('/index.html')` to open the test page
1. Ensure that the CSS selector used in the test code is consistently referenced in 'tasks.yml'.
1. Avoid overly strict test cases. Minimize direct assertions on CSS or HTML attributes. Instead, focus on validating the behavior of page elements—such as their size (e.g., width/height) and interactions (e.g., click, drag and drop).
